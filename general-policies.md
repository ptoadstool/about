## Notes on particular aspects of the course

## Lectures

This course often uses a [flipped classroom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom),
meaning that you will learn
a great deal of material prior to class and our time in the classroom,
together is spent

- summarizing the most important points;
- discussing the material; and,
- applying the material through activites, homework, or the class project.

Nearly every lecture has a set of required readings that you
will need to complete before class. Often, those readings will
include videos. After completing the
readings and prior to class, you will complete a short quiz
online (see below for more details) and also submit questions
via our Q&A system (more below also).

Class meetings are 80 minutes long.
In class, we will typically have
a "mini-lecture" and discussion through which we will recapitulate the
most important points of the readings. In most meetings, we will also
have some "activity". This
may include discussing your semester project or a guest speaker.

The activities in class will sometimes require that you have
a computer with you. You will require access to the network
and often access to a Unix-like computing environment. (Students using
an operating system not based on Unix may like to use a remote Unix-like host,
[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads), [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10), or a cloud environment
like [Cloud9](http://c9.io).)

### Quizzes

Most classes are preceeded by a short quiz. The quizzes will be
completed online _prior_ to the lectures. They usually consist of
multiple choice questions that test whether 1) the student completed
the assigned readings and video lectures; and, 2) understood the
most important concepts. Each quiz is timed: students have 15 minutes
to complete them once they are started. The nature of the questions
on the quizzes will vary. Some questions are simple and factual,
some test understanding, others require synthesis or research. You
take the quizzes through the class website.

I believe in pre-class quizzes and students in my previous classes indicated
that they were highly satisfied with the quizzing practices. Further, there is sound
empirical evidence that the [testing effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testing_effect)
increases your understanding and retention of material.
I believe the strongest arguments, from your perspective as a student, for frequent quizzes are as follows:

- they give you a small reward for coming to class prepared;
- they eliminate the need for cold calling, which creates a better classroom atmosphere;
- they ensure that your classmates are better prepared for class and therefore more fun to speak with;
- they are short, and you can drop your lowest scores, so they are not stressful;
- they allow you to accumulate your grade gradually throughout the semester, instead of relying on large exams (there are still exams in class, but their worth less than they'd be without quizzes);
- they allow you to develop a grade that is independent from your group project;
- they give us the freedom to use class for more enjoyable activities, confident that we all have a shared body of knowledge.

### Participation

Your participation in class improves the learning experience
for everybody: me, your colleagues, and yourself. Participation
is [recorded](https://github.com/kljensen/yelukerest/blob/master/db/src/data/yeluke/engagement.sql) on a per-class basis by the teaching staff.
See the
[grading notes](grading.md) for more information.

### The class project

See the [class project](class-project.md) section.

## Compromises

We would like to share with you some of the rationale for decisions we made
in designing the class project, with a focus on the compromises.

### Mix of theory and practice

It is unclear in what ratios we should mix theory and practice in this course.
There are many sound arguments for learning entrepreneurship through practice,
including that certain important lessons about entrepreneurship cannot be
learned except through practice, that practice will let you retain the material
better, that practice will lead to startups created out of the class, and that
practice is most engaging, so you are likely to enjoy the class better.
Arguments for theory include the following: theory helps you generalize better
than practice, theory allows you to cover more topics, and theory helps you
engage with the material in a manner that is more scholarly and befitting of
your liberal education at Yale.

I would like this class to be a mix of these two manners of teaching. I do not
know the "correct" ratio, though I feel that either extreme is not correct for
this class. I want you to experience the joys of practice and develop an
understanding of theory that generalizes beyond that practice.

As you can infer from the above, the goal of this course is not to “churn out”
technology start-ups or start-up founders— though, that would be a nice fringe benefit. The
goal of the course is to educate you, to help you individually each as Yale
students learn how to use computer science to build innovative technologies that
improve humanity in some way.

### Building it right or building it right now

In this course you will experience a tension between building software right
and building it right now. The entrepreneurship side of our course will, to a
first approximation, push you to build things quickly, potentially rife with
errors, in an effort to learn what should be built based on user experiences
with your error-rife software. The computer science side of our course will
push you to build things correctly: to employ best practices, to think through
a problem before writing code, to understand your requirements and how they can
be satisfied.

We will make a compromise between these two forces. When we cover the computer
science portions of this course, we will learn with particular application to an
entrepreneurial environment wherein there is great uncertainty, changing
requirements, and need for speed. When we cover the entrepreneurship portions,
we will not build as quickly as we could if you were a startup founder outside
the classroom. Instead, we will take the time to discuss how your software
should be built.

### Technology scope

Is unclear to me what the "correct" technology stack is for this course. If we
all decided to use a particular technology stack, we could of course go into
great depth and understand it intimately. (And, it would make life a lot easier
for the teaching staff.) This depth would come at the cost of lessons to be
learned from breadth. Furthermore, if we enforce a particular technology stack,
we would rob you of your freedom to choose that in which you feel most
productive, or that which you wish to learn most. For this semester's class, we
will err on the side of breadth, possibly at grave risk to our teaching staff.
You will be free to use whatever technologies you desire that conform to the
following guidelines. Your project, and your technology stack, should

- have a substantial
  networking component (a single player mobile game would not qualify);
- have
  some kind of social component (the data with which users interact may be
  altered by other users); and,
- be mobile first.

These guidelines will give us a great deal of interesting fodder for the
classroom: networking, data storage, application architecture, device
heterogeneity, and many more.

We would like to support students who would benefit from starter code,
and so we'll be providing a such code in the form of a node application
student groups are welcome to fork. Students who start with that code
may be likely to accrue better project grades, if only because they are likely
to get customer traction more quickly.

## Textbook

There is no textbook for the course. Readings will on Canvas or otherwise
online.
