## Grading

The course includes homework assignments,
quizzes, a group project, and participation. These are the only works
upon which students are graded.

Grades will be awarded as **roughly** as indicated below. This distribution
**will definitely change** over the course of the semester: we will skip
certain quizzes, certain assignments may become worth more or less,
assignments may be added, and
generally, the instructors will be constantly tweaking our class to maximize
our learning and enjoyment. At the
end of the semester, we suspect the grades will be roughly as follows.

- Individual assignments: roughly 210 points (~25%). These are the technical assignments you will complete, which are front-loaded at the beginning of the course.
- Quizzes: 13pts each. Expect roughly 20 over the course of the semester.
  Your lowest five quizzes will be dropped automatically and the total contribution
  of quizzes to the points in the class should be roughly 200pts (~23.5%).
  See the section on [quizzes](quizzes.md).
- Class Project: roughly 215pts (~25.5%) over the course of the semester, including the final presentation.
- Two exams: 60pts (~7%) each.
- Class participation: roughly 100pts (~12%). Class participation is divided roughly
  equally between in-class participation, online participation through
  the class Q&A system. The TAs will keep track of participation in class.
  _It is your responsibility to ensure the TAs record that you attended class
  and that you contributed._

There is no final exam.

Letter grades will be assigned at the end of the course based
on the [Yale grading policies](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ux93jd8ea2485uw/Grading%20Scales%20at%20Yale.doc?dl=0).
The students enrolled in MGT656 and MGT660 will be graded independently.
