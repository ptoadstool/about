# The class project

You will work together
on a class project: a web application for posting events and RSVPing
for those events, similar to Eventbrite (but way worse). The class project is
divided into separate scrum "[sprints](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_%28software_development%29#Sprint)", each one week long. In each
sprint there is a product manager and the rest of the team will act
as developers. Each sprint will have a different project manager,
who is responsible for writing the progress report. The developers
are responsible for writing code. The project will be evaluated in
two ways. First, the management of the project will be graded based
on the sprint progress reports. Second, the technical progress of
the project will be measured in an automated fashion: software written
by the instructors will, every day, test the behavior of your
application to see what fraction of the specifications have been
completed.

The functionality of your class project will be graded in an automated
fashion and I'll give you the testing code in advance, so you know
how you're doing on the project at any point. Once it is released,
you'll want to check often for updates to the testing code---it
will change as we add requirements during the course of the project
and fix bugs, which are inevitable. The requirements for the project
are described in the README in the testing code and therein you'll
also find instructions for running the testing code.

As this git commit, we're still finalizing the project. We'll update
this documentation soon.
